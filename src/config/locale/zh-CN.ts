      `Nervos is a suite of scalable and interoperable protocols and an open blockchain "Trustware" platform for decentralized applications. Trustware is a new decentralized computing paradigm that goes beyond distributed ledgers and smart contracts, to bring general expression of trust to meet the demand of today's real world applications. `,
      `In contrast to smart contract platforms, Nervos uses the "Common Knowledge Base", a simpler state machine with uniform state transation semantics for superior scalability, interoperability and better aligned incentives for all participants of the network.`,
